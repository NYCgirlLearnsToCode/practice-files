#Reflection - Project

##Letter to self
Dear Lisa,
The day will come when you're totally stuck. It's happened before, quite a few times. Remember how far you've come. It's all a learning experience. You will consult all the available resources. The first step would be to search Google, Stack Overflow. If you can't find an answer online, go consult your peers. If your peers don't know, consult friends and contacts that have more experience as programmers or are working in the field as developers/engineers. You got this.

##Goals

My goal I hope to reach by the end of this Udacity Front-end course is to fully understand and be well-versed in how to fully scaffold and develop a project. My long term goals are to contribute to open source projects for social impact. One problem I have been facing is that it's been quite hard to find specific tutorials on putting a website together. There are alot of resources that speak about syntax and the parts of a website but I haven't really encountered many that take you from start to finish for building a website.
