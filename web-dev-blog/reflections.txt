What new skills have you learned?
I have learned <figure> and <figcaption>. I did not know those existed before taking this udacity course.

What has been easy?
Everything has been okay so far.

What has been difficult?
It hasn't been too difficult, just formatting the mockup to exact spacing was the most difficult part. I added some css. I didn't get that perfect spacing.

How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
For the author line, I used the heading tag but the "By" ended up on another line break so I had to think of an alternate to get it on the same line. I couldn't remember how to italicize and bold so I googled it and used that instead so By: author name would be on the same line.
